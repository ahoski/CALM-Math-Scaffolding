# CALM-Math-Scaffolding
This repository contains the raw outputs and evaluation data from a study comparing metacognitive scaffolding in large language models (LLMs) using the CALM framework. The study evaluated three model conditions on 10 open-ended high school math questions: Baseline GPT-4, CALM-prompted GPT-4 and CALM-prompted Claude Sonnet 4.
